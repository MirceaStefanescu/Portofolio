# Portofolio

This repository contains multiple projects. Each project lives at the repository
root in its own folder.

## Structure

- `<Project Name>/` - one project per folder at the repo root

## Project Guidelines

- Each project should include a `README.md` with:
  - short description
  - tech stack
  - current status
  - how to run/build/test
- Keep project directories self-contained.
- If a project has separate apps, use subfolders such as:
  - `frontend/`
  - `backend/`
  - `infra/`
  - `docs/`

## Current Projects

- `Full Stack E-commerce Application with Angular and Spring Boot`
